Algorithm:
take input then:
1. Initialize a long long variable miss to 1, representing the smallest number that cannot be formed.
2. Initialize an integer variable added to 0, representing the number of elements added to the array.
3. Initialize an integer variable i to 0 for iterating through the array.
4. While miss is less than or equal to n:
     a. If i is within bounds and nums[i] is less than or equal to miss:
          i. Increment miss by nums[i].
          ii. Increment i.
     b. Otherwise, miss cannot be formed using the current elements:
          i. Increment miss by doubling its current value.
          ii. Increment added by 1 to represent adding miss to the array.
5. Print the value of added as the minimum number of patches required to form any number in the range [1, n] inclusive.
